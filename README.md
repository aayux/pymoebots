This repository was rebased from [JesseTCS/bot_algorithm](#), which is now under [RUC-Shende](https://github.com/RUC-Shende/programmable_particles_app_engine). The original source was intended as a simulator for Leader Election in the Amoebot model using Python.

The original front-end was written by [dbushta](https://github.com/dbushta) and [chri55](https://github.com/chri55).
