### Acknowledgements

This project is based on work by the [SOPS Group](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/).

The repository was rebased from [RUC-Shende/programmable-particles](https://github.com/RUC-Shende/programmable-particles). The original front-end was written by [dbushta](https://github.com/dbushta) and [chri55](https://github.com/chri55), and [JesseTCS](https://github.com/JesseTCS) wrote the simulator for the Leader Election algorithm in the Amoebot model.

### Contributing

Because of multiple sources and variable timelines, the commit history is somewhat messy. Following the first release version, all contributions must follow the newest [guidelines](https://github.com/aayux/aayux/pymoebots/CONTRIBUTING.md).
