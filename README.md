# Algorithms for Evacuating Mobile Agents from an Area

**This research is supported by the National Science Foundation under grant # CCF-AF 1813940 (RUI: Search, Evacuation and Reconfiguration with Coordinated Mobile Agents).**

Algorithms for mobile agents in a specific area to search for an exit along a perimeter and
evacuate, based on wireless and non-wireless communication models. These algorithms will be saved and loaded by the program as `.icl` files, which will be read in by the application.

Example algorithms will be sorted into directories based on the type of area that the algorithm explores.
Subdirectories will denote the type of communication model being used for the algorithm.
