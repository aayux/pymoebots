## Pymoebot
### Stochastic Algorithms simulator for the Amoebot Model based on work by the [SOPS Group](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/)

This repository is rebased from [JesseTCS/bot_algorithm](https://github.com/JesseTCS/bot_algorithm) which is currently in alpha. Their group has built a simulator for Leader Election in the Amoebot model using Python. The old code was written using JavaScript that has now mostly been deprecated in favour of the new Python codebase.
