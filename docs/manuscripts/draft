A non-technical draft for ideas

Code

1. all nodes have the same fixed port labellings?

2. CURRENT: Optimize amoebot.core.node.manager.Node.link() and solve -- orientation of ports is rotated by 90 in the stochastic work; A: just change the direction of links.

3. How to place non-gridlike obstacles or walls on the grid
	> under grid
	> drop objects or fixed objects?
