* Stochastic Maze Solving with the Geometric Amobeot Model
--------------------------------------------------------
** A non-technical draft for ideas

*** Notes on the Algorithm

	1. all nodes have the same fixed port labellings? ::
	+ Nodes do, bots don't

	2. orientation of ports is rotated by 90 in the stochastic work :: 
	+ just change the direction of links

	3. How much memory does an amoebot use ::

	4. How to place non-gridlike obstacles or walls on the grid ::
	+ remove regular node objects from Node, make them inaccessible
	+ for viz: 1/2 widths on either end and fill

	5. restructure agents ::
	+ strip away message handling abilities and refer to them as function calls to methods of class `MessageHandler` only

	6. How many agents can a bot launch ::
	+ wrt movement there can be no more than one competing agent per bot
	+ stationary algorithms may have the possibility of assigning more than one agent to task -- depends

**** TODO start writing test cases
**** TODO create bot configurations in json format
**** DONE write functions for random movement
**** TODO place blocking objects on grid
**** TODO server: create a Django backend
